**Note: This is copy of [pixel-canvas](https://github.com/S4d3ngineer/pixel-canvas) but it is migrated to environment, which was created using Vite.**

**App is currently WIP** (still in early stage I would say).

## Goal
Goal of this project is to create app allowing to create simple pixel art and test if I can achieve it in
React without Canvas Web API.

## Roadmap

### Will implement:
- Ability to change canvas size.
- Scaling canvas to fit its container and zoom in/out into canvas.
- Color picker and ability to change pen color/size and canvas background color.
- Ability to save drawing in .svg format.
- New interface/color palette for app.

### Quite Possible:
- Migrate to use Canvas Web API if current solution will be insufficient.
- Mobile and touch screen support.
